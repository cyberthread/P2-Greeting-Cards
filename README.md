# Project 2: Series of 3 Greeting Cards
_Modules 2 & 3: September 15â€“October 26_
Due on Wednesday, October 27

For this assignment you should create a series of 3 e-greetings with a consistent style/theme. Each card should be for a different holiday but should reuse/share some visual, story and code elements. Emphasis should be placed on bringing delight to the audience. Consider surprises and details that enrich the experience.
A good place to start is familiarizing yourself with the tools of motion and interaction including CSS animation and the basics of Javascript and accessibility principles associated with them. I recommend the following Deque University courses:
- [Designing an Accessible User Experience](https://dequeuniversity.com/class/ux/)
- [Multimedia, Animations and Motion](https://dequeuniversity.com/class/multimedia/)

Consider reviewing the following LinkedIn Learning Courses:
- [CSS: Animation](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/css-animation-14153685/css-animation-advantages?u=42832580)
- [CSS: Enhancing Interfaces with Animation](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/css-enhancing-interfaces-with-animation/why-animations?u=42832580)
- [JavaScript Essential Training](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/javascript-essential-training/javascript-the-soil-from-which-the-modern-web-grows?u=42832580)

## Specs
- 3 web-based greeting cards with a consistent theme/style that are live on the web
- Consider putting together a mini style guide to help with consistency
- Each card should:
 - Include a combination of text and image
